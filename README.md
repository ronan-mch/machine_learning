# Overview

This repository consists of data and scripts for our machine learning assignment(s). The dataset we have chosen is the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle. This dataset contains a list of passengers on the Titanic together with several of their characteristics including age, sex, seating class, the price paid for their ticket and whether or not they survived.
